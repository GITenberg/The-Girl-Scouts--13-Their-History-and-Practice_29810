<h2>GIRL SCOUTS</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">Pg 1</a></span></p>


<p><i>History of the American Girl Scouts.</i> When Sir
Robert Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scout movement
in England, it proved too attractive and too
well adapted to youth to make it possible to limit its
great opportunities to boys alone. The Sister organization,
known in England as the Girl Guides, quickly
followed it and won equal success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Juliette Low, an American visitor in England,
and a personal friend of the father of Scouting,
realized the tremendous future of the movement for
her country; and with the active and friendly co-operation
of the Baden-Powells, she founded the Girl
Guides in America, enrolling the first patrols in
Savannah, Georgia, in March, 1912.</p>

<p>In 1913 National Headquarters were established
in Washington, D.C., and the name changed to
Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>In 1915 the organization was incorporated with
the legal title, Girl Scouts, Incorporated.</p>

<p>In 1916 National Headquarters were moved to
New York and the methods and standards of what
was plainly to be a nation-wide organization became
established on a broad, practical basis.</p>

<p>The first National Convention was held in 1915,
and each succeeding year has shown a larger and
more enthusiastic body of delegates and a public
more and more interested in this steadily growing
army of girls and young women who are learning
in the happiest way to combine patriotism, outdoor
activities of every kind, skill in every branch of domestic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">Pg 2</a></span>
science and high standards of community
service.</p>

<p>Every side of the girl's nature is brought out and
developed by enthusiastic captains, who join in the
games and various forms of training and encourage
team work and fair play. For the instruction of the
captains, national camps and training schools are
being established all over the country; and the
schools and churches everywhere are co-operating
eagerly with this great recreational movement,
which they realize adds something to the life of the
growing girl that they have been unable to supply.</p>

<p>Colleges are offering fellowships in scouting as a
serious course for would-be captains, and prominent
citizens in every part of the country are identifying
themselves with local councils in an advisory and
helpful capacity. At the present writing, nearly
60,000 girls and more than 3,000 captains represent
the original little troop in Savannah&mdash;surely a satisfying
sight for our Founder and National President,
when she realizes what a healthy sprig she has
transplanted from the Mother Country!</p>

<p><i>Aims.</i> While the aims of Scouting are similar to
those of the schools, the church and the home, its
methods are less direct and success depends upon
the attraction which the program has for the girls.
Belonging to an organization, the uniform, such
novel activities as knot-tying, hiking, signalling and
drilling, the chance for leadership, the laws to which
they voluntarily subscribe and the recognition of
ability by the system of giving badges are the distinctive
elements of Scouting. They succeed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">Pg 3</a></span>
bringing about improved health, approved standards
of behavior towards others, a general arousing of
the imagination as well as practical knowledge.</p>

<p>The ideal background for the entire program is
cheerful companionship in the open.</p>

<p><i>Standards.</i> The standards of the Girl Scouts are
expressed in their Laws and Promise, their Motto
and Slogan which are as follows:</p>

<h4>Motto</h4>

<div class="center">&ldquo;Be Prepared&rdquo;</div>


<h4>Slogan</h4>

<div class="center">&ldquo;Do a Good Turn Daily&rdquo;</div>
<br />


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span>The best results are obtained by emphasizing the
fact that these ways are the girl's own idea of the
way to live, her choice. Success in expressing one's
own ideas never fails to give satisfaction. Clever
parents and teachers make use of this. &ldquo;A Scout is
cheerful&rdquo; is a more effective method of influencing
a girl, for instance, than any amount of advice on
the subject.</p>

<p>It seems to be more and more difficult to induce
girls to learn or practice housework. For the average
woman this is still necessary, and the more advanced
schools have taken it up. For the girl whom
neither the home nor the school has been able to
reach, Scouting offers a most successful and attractive
means of getting the practical information to
the young generation. They will do for &ldquo;merit
badges,&rdquo; in other words, what they will not do for
their mothers or teachers.</p>

<p>An effective manner of upholding and exercising
these standards, is, as has been abundantly proved
by the great war, the uniform. Earning and proving
worthy of it stimulates child, girl and woman
alike. Uniform and ceremony, not overemphasized,
but duly insisted upon, have a profound significance
to the human race, and teach us to sink the individual
interests and raise the standards of the group.</p>

<p><i>Leadership and The Patrol System.</i> In general a
troop should not contain more than thirty or forty
girls. Many very experienced captains have larger
troops when they have several lieutenants to assist
them. The troops are divided into groups, or patrols
of eight and treated as units, each under its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span>
responsible leader. An invaluable step in character
building is to put responsibility on the individual.
This is done in electing a Patrol Leader to be responsible
for the control of her Patrol. Leaders should
serve a limited time and every girl in a patrol should
have the experience of serving some time during her
membership. It is up to her to take hold and develop
the qualities of each girl in her Patrol. It
sounds a big order, but in practice it works. With a
friendly rivalry established between patrols a patrol
esprit de corps is developed and each girl in that
patrol realizes that she is herself a responsible unit
and that the honor of her group depends on her
efficiency in playing the game. The patrol system
is an essential feature in Scouting. When this is
lost sight of and the attitude of a teacher is adopted,
making the troop a <i>class</i>, the vital spirit or meaning
of Scouting is missed entirely. Although a powerful
personality always can succeed with young
people, in individual instances, it would be impossible
to get enough of these people to make any impression
upon the thousands of girls in the organization.
Moreover, the average child is already
overloaded with things to learn. What nobody
teaches her is how to control herself, and thus learn
to control others and take her share of responsibility.
The whole Scouting technique is adapted to
exactly this idea and the patrol leader is the key note
of it.</p>

<p><i>The troop whose captain is (apparently) not managing
it, but whose girls manage themselves under
the Scout laws, is the ideal troop.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Court of Honor.</i> The Patrol Leaders and
their &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; form the &ldquo;Court of Honor,&rdquo; which
manages the internal affairs of the troop. Its institution
is the best guarantee for permanent vitality
and success for the troop. It takes a great deal of
minor routine work off the shoulders of the Scout
captain, and at the same time gives to the girls a
real responsibility and a serious outlook on the
affairs of their troop. It was mainly due to the
Patrol Leaders and to the Courts of Honor that the
British Boy Scouts were able to carry on useful work
during the war. The Court of Honor decides rewards
and punishments, and interprets rules in individual
instances.</p>

<p><i>Methods.</i> Not only should the activities be those
which they are not getting through other channels,
but they should be presented in ways which attract
the girls. It should never be forgotten that Scouting
is chosen by the girls because it <i>interests them</i>. Use
as bait the food the fish likes. If you bait your hook
with the kind of food that you yourself like, unless
you happen to have a natural affinity for young
people, it is probable that you will not catch many.
If the Scouting program fails to interest girls, they
will find something that does.</p>

<p>The program should be varied, and never iron-clad,
but adapted to fill the needs of the special girl.
Examples: Few city girls have much chance to be in
the country. An effort should be made to get them
out on hikes, and week-end camping trips. Some
homes and schools do not teach the girls such practical
things as cooking, bedmaking, while some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>
groups of girls have no conception of obligation to
other people or any sense of citizenship. In each
case, the wise captain attempts to discover the novel
activity, which besides being helpful, will attract the
girls. The wise captain does not expect girls to pay
great attention to any one subject for very long,
and does not teach or lecture. They get enough of
that in school. The captain is rather a sort of older
playfellow who lets the girl choose activities which
interest her and she will learn for herself.</p>

<p>Most of the activities will be of the nature of play.
Play is always a means to mental and physical
development. The best play leads towards adult
forms of leadership, co-operation, entertaining, artistic
execution and community service.</p>

<p>Any captain who finds herself judging her troop's
efficiency by the old fashioned system of examination
marks based on a hundred per cent scale, shows
herself out of touch not only with the Scouting
spirit, but with the whole trend of modern education
today. When the tendency of great universities
is distinctly toward substituting psychological
tests for examinations, when the United States
Army picks its officers by such tests, it would be
absurd for a young people's recreational movement
to wear its members out by piling such work on captain
and scout!</p>

<p>Examinations and tests should lay weight on what
can be <i>done</i> within time limits and in first class
form; also on the effort expended by the girls, and
not on what can be <i>written or recited</i>. Young people
love such tests&mdash;which relate closely to games&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>
they are of great practical value in daily life. They
are the tests we meet every day. They interest the
community to watch and experts are always ready
and interested to judge them. But nobody is interested
in examination papers, and school children and
especially captains should not be taxed with more
than the absolute necessity of proving a candidate's
fair grasp of the subject.</p>

<p>In this connection great latitude should be allowed
for the captain's knowledge of her girls and their
real ability and attitude. The girls are also good
judges of each other. Remember that the girl with
the best examination paper is not necessarily the
best Scout.</p>

<p><i>The Council.</i> The Patrol System, under the captain,
is the vital <i>inside</i> of Scouting: in order to tie
the organization closely to the community, the council
must be well selected, strong and active. An
ideal council should represent the best homes in the
community, the church and the school. Some leading
woman, whose acquaintance is wide, should most
certainly be on it, in order to help the captain out
with a list of people qualified to judge the merit
badges, for instance. Interested women who will
help in camps, hikes, sales, moving picture benefits,
rallies are most necessary, and the captain should
feel no hesitation in asking advice or help from her
council. At least one member whose daughter is in
the local troop should be a practical link between the
home and the troop, but all members should make a
point of understanding the principles and distinctive
methods of Scouting and see that they are carried
out in their locality.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
